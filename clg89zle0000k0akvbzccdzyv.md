This course is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of asynchronous JavaScript programming, which is a fundamental concept in modern web development. You will learn to write JavaScript code to **handle asynchronous tasks, such as making API requests, working with Promises, handling events, and managing timeouts.**

The course will cover the principles of asynchronous programming, best practices, and common patterns for handling asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Students will also learn how to debug and troubleshoot asynchronous code and how to optimize performance.
